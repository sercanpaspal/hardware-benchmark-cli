# Hardware Benchmark Cli


[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hwb.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/hwb)

Find easy and fast hardware benchmark point and specifications.

It's actually not a very necessary tool. I developed this tool for myself because I like to follow computer hardware and make comparisons very often. Another reason why I did this project is to improve myself and learn something new.
